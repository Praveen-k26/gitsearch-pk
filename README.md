### GitSearch
This is a simple git search application. Enter the user name and click on search to see a list of first 20 repositories. The table displays the Repo name, date it is created on, date updated on, number of stars and forks as well. 

Also, you will get to see a card right next to the table. The card displays further more details about the owner like the Profile picture, Username, bio,location, profession, contact details, website and the twitter handle.

### Installation
1. Clone the project.
2. `cd` into the project.
3. Install the `nodemodules` using `npm install`.
4. `npm start`

### Personal Access Token
You will need to have a `Personal Access Token` in order to access the Github v4 API.
The following steps will guide you through the process.
1. Login to your Github account.
2. Click on your Profile picture on the top right corner of the screen.
3. Go to settings.
4. Click `Developer Settings`.
5. Select Personal Access Tokens.
6. Generate a new key.
7. Create a `.env` file in your Project folder's root.
8. Make sure you add your .env file to `.gitignore` so that you don't commit your `PAT` by accident.

### Features
# Search for a user and see their repositories.
When a user types a text in the search bar and hits submit, a query is triggered to fetch a list of required details. You click on `clear button`, it will clear the text from the input field.It displays the data if a valid user name is searched. In case of a network issue or if the user does not exist, it will display a generic error message. I used `apollo-boost`, `react-apollo`, `graphql-tag`, `graphql`, `apollo-client` npm packages for this purpose.

# Enabling themes on this application.
It all depends on the boolean value, for this I created a custom toggle switch. I gave it a bit of styling, to make it look a little fancy kind of representing day and night for dark and light themes. I made sure it would not flash or stay blank during the switch. The switch will have a boolean value, which is passed the over the application through `Context API. `

#Testing(Bonus with Cypress)
I used `Jest,enzymes` for the unit testing and cypress for the end to end testing.
I ran all the basic unit tests possible, their existence,components rendering without an error and for their functionality. Honestly no matter how many tests we write, there will always be a scope to find a new scenario to test. Since the time frame is limited, I restricted myself to a limited but decent number of tests. These tests can be triggered by typing `npm test`
Cypress would do a round of basic testing, like visiting the page, entering the text, submitting the form, making a query and clearing the test. Cypress testing can be triggered by a custom script `cypress open`

### My Folder Structure
All the components have their own folders which include their css file and their test file.
For consistancy, I follow a pattern, all my components end with `filename.component.jsx`, my css files end with `filename.styles.css` and test files with `filename.test.js`.
Most of the components I used are custom components. I had them in a customized file, destructed their properties, which makes it easy to use as common components. The following is my folder structure.
-cypress
  -integration
    -gitsearch
-Screens
-src
-test
The `screens` folder has the images of the flowchart, and the themes.
`Cypress` is autogenerated when installed.

Now let's breakdown our `src` folder.
-src
 -assets
 -components
   -button
   -card
   -errorMessage
   -layout
   -navbar
   -profileCard
   -repoList
   -searchbar
   -spinner
   -toggleSwitch
 -context
 -errorHandling
 -graphql
 -themes
 
Basically, the `App.js` acts as the parent,within which I have a Layout component. All the other components are in the `Layout Component`. This helped me a lot while dealing with Context Api. Also not to forget the `index.js` file. I had the `<App />` component enclosed in an `<ErrorBoundary/>` tag, which again is enclosed in an `ContextAPI` tag, which again is enclosed in a `Apollo Provider` tag. I know!! so much of nesting, but yeah, this is not as complicated as it looks.

Also, working with Graphql was fun. I've always been working with REST apis but graphql queries is something else. I enjoyed all way working on graphql, making queries. Considering myself as a newbee (to Graphql), I succeeded in creating a happy flow, made a query and generated the results. I think I've done a pretty good job on my first attempt.

Same goes with Cypress, but it was way too fun. I would love to write more test cases in cypress now. I have installed an npm package using `npm install cypress --save-dev`.
Following this I added a couple of scripts, reinstalled my node modules using `npm install`.
running `cypress open` would trigger cypress. 

This will open a whole new window also you will have a cypress folder auto generated in the folder. In the cypress folder, go to Integration folder and this is where you write your tests. 

##Final Verdict:
 I had a wonderful time working on this challenge. It helped me learn new concepts, brush up my existing skills and an amazing intro to Graphql and Cypress. I had to restric myself in many aspects because of the time contraints. I would love to keep adding more updates to this particular project.
